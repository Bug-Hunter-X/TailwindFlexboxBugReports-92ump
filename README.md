# Unexpected Behavior of Flex Items in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's flexbox utilities.  The issue involves unexpected rendering or behavior of flex items when using specific combinations of classes, particularly `items-center` and `space-x-4` within a `flex` container.  The problem might manifest as incorrect spacing, misalignment, or overflow of flex items.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code. The `solution.html` file offers potential solutions and workarounds to resolve the issue, depending on its root cause.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Conflicting class combinations:** Certain class combinations might unexpectedly interact, leading to the unwanted behavior.  This often involves utilities related to spacing, alignment, and flexbox layout.
* **Missing or incorrect parent container styles:** The parent container might need additional styles (like `width` or `max-width`) to correctly accommodate the flex items.
* **Unintended interactions with other CSS:** Conflicting styles from other CSS rules might interfere with Tailwind's flexbox implementation.
* **Version incompatibility:** Ensure you're using a compatible version of Tailwind CSS and any relevant dependencies. 

**Solutions:**

The `solution.html` provides solutions based on common scenarios. It might include adding missing styles, adjusting class combinations, or using more explicit flexbox properties.

This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing class combinations in Tailwind CSS to prevent unexpected behavior.
